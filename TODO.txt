Edit compare function to enable comparing terms generated by different comm functions together and create simplified number of terms. This involves editing nondummymap in compare function. 

Edit compare function to enable picking of terms instead of projecting on X1

Edit compare function to reduce time taking process.
	
R and S commutator ->
	change the class large operator to term	so that V can be selected for R and N in the same way as any particualr operator. 
	check with adding 2 same comutattor. I have a doubt that it is wrong. 
	check the sign of the commutator junzi pointted out. there might be a problem
