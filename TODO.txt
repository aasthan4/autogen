MISC 
	no need(check)- delete the terms that haev 0 contribution in compare envelope
	
operator -> full hamiltonian 
	compare again to produce full Hamiltonian
R and S commutator ->
	change the class large operator to term	so that V can be selected for R and N in the same way as any particualr operator.
