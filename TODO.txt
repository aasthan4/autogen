	
operator -> full hamiltonian 
R and S commutator ->
	change the class large operator to term	so that V can be selected for R and N in the same way as any particualr operator. 
	check with adding 2 same comutattor. I have a doubt that it is wrong. 
	check the sign of the commutator junzi pointted out. there might be a problem
