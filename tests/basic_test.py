#the input of the commutator function is as follows :
#if you want a commutator [V,T2]-> comm['op1'],['op2'],prefactor)

#The following function selects only the fully contracted terms from the above list_terms

#Case of a nested commutator :
#Note that the name of the operators of the same type are different 
#Like T1,T11,T12,T13 etc

#Case of Deexcitation operators
#Deexcitation operators can be defined by the letter D,everything else remain the same
#Notice that we are not using the full_con function here, so it will print all terms, not just fully contracted.
