Include use of 4 commutators: 1. edit special conditions in library. It has middle operators in case two. These middle operators might be designed to handle just one middle operator not two. 
	
R and S commutator ->
	change the class large operator to term	so that V can be selected for R and N in the same way as any particualr operator. 
	check with adding 2 same comutattor. I have a doubt that it is wrong. 
	check the sign of the commutator junzi pointted out. there might be a problem
	

*
include Active States
Extended Wicks Theorem
Use of triple excitation
